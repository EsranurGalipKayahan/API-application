ERROR: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at UPS API.

REASON: It occurs when I am trying to access an API which doesn't lie in the same domain.

FIX: Server should enable CORS requests allowing API to be accessed in a different domain through Access-Control-Allow-Origin header

## RESULT: I change the project topic :)

ERROR: Background music does not play automatically.

REASON : Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be avoided when possible. And browsers block the audio.

FIX: The user has interacted with the site (by clicking, tapping, pressing keys, etc.)
